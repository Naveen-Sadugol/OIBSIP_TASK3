# OIBSIP_TASK3

I have Developed a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

The to-do web app allows users to add new items to a list. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks appears on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

I also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion.  Irrespective of the list, a user can also be able to delete or edit tasks from it.

Used javascript to perform add , delete ,etc for the tasks entered by user.Also used different CSS properties!
